## Why?

I have built a few portfolio's, but I wanted one that really showed my skills as a web developer. I wanted a portfolio that didn't only serve as a place for recruiters to stop by and be wowed by my skills, but I thought this should also be a place where people can actually see what I do, and can pay for my services.

## Future Features!!!
 #### Menu ideas:
 - Every hover changes the background picture
  !Currently only for large screens

  onMouseEnter = change picture to this thingy
  onMouseLeave = change picture back to original

  also a way to make the pictures not as overwhelming would be to make them faded, and to animate them to fly in rather than abruptly change

  Also, each li could have a video that plays of like a pokemon that interacts with the word. **Charzard stands up and shoots fire at the home li which catches fire and falls to the bottom of the div in ashes.

#### Home ideas:

 - When hovering over the word WEB DEVELOPER it expands
 - When you click on the Word it flips the div over and shows a 'Spin' component.
 - The component works like the apple date select where you and click and drag to 'spin' through the different tech that I am familiar with.

 [Kind of looks like this.](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdocs-assets.developer.apple.com%2Fpublished%2F9b72935ec7%2F293b359e-e6be-4152-b7e0-c6022f899490.png%26imgrefurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Fdocumentation%2Fuikit%2Fuidatepicker%26tbnid%3DWJTMcdSS4h2jaM%26vet%3D12ahUKEwi3-LnqudX3AhXLmWoFHSaaBRsQMygEegUIARDfAQ..i%26docid%3DdoGAIpnTXqow2M%26w%3D663%26h%3D377%26q%3Dapple%20date%20selector%26ved%3D2ahUKEwi3-LnqudX3AhXLmWoFHSaaBRsQMygEegUIARDfAQ)

- When hovering over my image the Github && LinkedIn icons appear, and expand. They are clickable.
