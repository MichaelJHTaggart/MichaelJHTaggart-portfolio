## Why?

I have built a few portfolio's, but I wanted one that really showed my skills as a web developer. I wanted a portfolio that didn't only serve as a place for recruiters to stop by and be wowed by my skills, but I thought this should also be a place where people can actually see what I do, and can pay for my services.
